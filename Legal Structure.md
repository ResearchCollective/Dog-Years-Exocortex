SEC declared that The DAO (2017) was a security but did not pursue action against them. 

Three-Pronged Framework: In June 2025, the SEC introduced a new framework to supplement the Howey Test for classifying crypto tokens as securities, reflecting a more nuanced approach:

- Initial Sale Context: Was the token marketed as an investment opportunity? Promotional materials suggesting profits increase the likelihood of securities classification.
    
- Ongoing Use: Does the token have functional utility in a decentralized network? Tokens used for governance or network operations (common in DAOs) may lean toward non-security status if not tied to profit expectations.
    
- Issuer Influence: How much control does the founding team or core group retain? Greater decentralization reduces the likelihood of being deemed a security

***Desci Daos probably still qualify as securities, but Reg D exemptions might help...***


## Limitations Under Rule 504 of Reg D for Token Sales

- **Offering Size Limit**: The DAO can raise up to $10 million in securities (tokens) within a 12-month period without registration with the SEC[2](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulationd.asp)[3](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/rule-504-regulation-d)[7](https://www.sec.gov/resources-small-businesses/exempt-offerings/exemption-limited-offerings-not-exceeding-10-million-rule-504-regulation-d)[8](https://www.sec.gov/resources-small-businesses/small-business-compliance-guides/rule-504-regulation-d-small-entity-compliance-guide-issuers).Â Some sources mention $5 million as a limit, likely reflecting earlier versions or specific interpretations, but the current SEC limit is $10 million[2](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulationd.asp)[3](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/rule-504-regulation-d)[7](https://www.sec.gov/resources-small-businesses/exempt-offerings/exemption-limited-offerings-not-exceeding-10-million-rule-504-regulation-d).

**Number and Type of Investors**: Rule 504 allows sales to an unlimited number of investors, both accredited and non-accredited

**Form D Filing**: The issuer must file Form D electronically with the SEC within 15 days after the first sale of securities


**1) Market Differentiation:** "While others are doing governance tokens with unclear value propositions, we're creating the first DeSci equity token that gives investors actual ownership stakes in IP and revenue streams. This attracts serious biotech capital that won't touch pure governance tokens."

**2) Compliance as Competitive Advantage:** "The 1-year lock-up isn't a bug, it's a feature. It signals to institutional investors that we're building for long-term value, not speculation. Biotech investors are used to 7-15 year hold periods anyway."

**3) Scalability Framework:** "This Series LLC structure lets us raise the initial $1M through your verein model, then seamlessly add traditional biotech investors through AngelList SPVs, and later expand to public token sales - all within one legal framework."

**4) Risk Mitigation:** Your current approach actually reduces legal risk by:

- Starting with compliant exempt offerings
- Building proper equity backing before public trading
- Creating clear separation between governance and economic rights

**Specific Ask for the Incubator:** "Can we modify your standard AMM approach to include a 1-year vesting/lock-up schedule? This lets us demonstrate a new model for DeSci fundraising that bridges traditional biotech investment and token innovation."

**The Regulatory Angle:** With your $50K+ VC commitments already happening privately, you're effectively doing Rule 504 already. The verein structure just adds an international wrapper that doesn't change the underlying compliance requirements.

**Bottom Line for Your Pitch:** "This isn't about choosing between traditional or crypto funding - it's about creating a new category that gets the best of both. We're not just raising money, we're establishing a template other DeSci projects will copy."


**Veto Rights Structure:** Your stakeholder-specific veto powers are brilliant and align with regenerative principles. Consider formalizing these as "protective provisions" in your operating agreement:

- Participants: veto over data licensing, commercialization, and privacy policy changes
- Investors: veto over dilutive financings, major asset dispositions, fundamental business changes
- Founders: supermajority requirement (67-75%) for removal, veto over key hiring/firing decisions

**Participant Representation Innovation:** Since study participants are creating the foundational data value, consider giving them:

- Escalating governance rights based on participation duration/quality
- "Data dignity" rights - ability to withdraw data under certain conditions
- Revenue sharing from commercialized research they contributed to
**Stakeholder-Weighted Council System:** Instead of equal board seats, create councils with different voting weights:

- **Capital Council** (SPV1-4): 40% weight on financial decisions
- **Contributor Council** (Teams, Advisors, Participants): 35% weight on research direction
- **Research Council** (Research Projects 1-3): 25% weight on IP/licensing decisions

**Functional Governance Layers:** Different decisions flow through different governance mechanisms:

- **Strategic Layer**: All series vote on fundamental direction
- **Operational Layer**: Only active contributors (teams + current participants) vote on day-to-day research
- **Financial Layer**: Capital providers + research projects vote on funding allocation
- **Data/IP Layer**: Participants + research projects control data usage and IP licensing

**Dynamic Representation Models:**

- **Rotating Committees**: Representatives change based on current project phases
- **Issue-Specific Coalitions**: Ad-hoc groups form around specific decisions (e.g., Research Projects 1+2 team up with Later Participants on a data sharing proposal)
- **Expertise-Weighted Voting**: Scientific decisions weighted toward teams/advisors, business decisions toward SPVs

**Economic Interdependence Mechanisms:**

- **Cross-Series Revenue Sharing**: Research projects pay licensing fees to participant series, teams get equity in research project success
- **Internal Markets**: Series can "trade" resources, data access, or decision rights with each other
- **Success Cascades**: Later series get enhanced rights/returns if earlier series hit milestones

**Accountability Networks:**

- **Peer Review Boards**: Research projects evaluate each other's progress
- **Stakeholder Advocacy**: Each series appoints representatives to advocate for other series' interests (preventing pure self-interest)
- **Rotating Leadership**: Executive authority rotates between series based on performance/contribution metrics

**Hybrid Digital-Physical Governance:**

- **Conviction Voting** for resource allocation between research projects
- **Quadratic Voting** for participant series on data usage policies
- **Traditional Board** for fiduciary and legal compliance decisions
- **Prediction Markets** for research milestone betting between series
